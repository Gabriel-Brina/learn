# input() = A function that prompts the user to enter data
#           Returns the entered data as a string

name = input("Whats your name?")

age = input(f"How old are you {name}?")

print('Happy Birthday!') #-> don't need the "f" string because you only use f when you want to insert information
print(f"So you are {age} years old.")
